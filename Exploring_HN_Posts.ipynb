    "# Exploring Hacker News Posts\n",
    "In this project, we will compare two types of posts from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), an extremely popular site in technology and startup circles where user-submitted stories (also known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon. The posts we're specifically interested in exploring begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question (i.e, \"Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?\"). Likewise, users submit `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n",
    "- Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), but note that the data set we will be working with has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions."

    "In this project, we compared ask posts to show posts to determine which kind of posts receives more comments on average, and then we determined which hours of the days receive the most comments on average. Based on our findings, an ask post created between 12:00 and 13:00 (12:00 pm pst to 1:00 pm pst) is recommended for receiving the highest number of comments.\n",
